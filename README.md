# hyuzu
hyuzu is a mashup game project, totally not inspired by a similar rhythm game that starts with an F.

Planned features include:
- Ability to use FUSER customs
- More customizable settings (custom disc colors, adjustable BPM limits, etc.)
- Mostly everything FUSER has to offer in terms of gameplay (risers, pickups, hotclips, etc.)
- Adjustable size for crates
- UI enhancements
- More
